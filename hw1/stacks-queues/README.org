* Part 3: Stacks & Queues

* Usage 

#+begin_src bash
make main

./main
#+end_src

* Instructions
** Implement the stack class from scratch. It contains the following methods:
- push ()
- pop ()
- top () 
- isEmpty()
- min() returns the minumum element of the stack in O(1) time 
  - Bonus: improve min() to have an O(1) time and O(1) space optimized.
  - Implement queues using the stack you made
