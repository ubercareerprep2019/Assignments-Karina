* Part 3: Stacks & Queues

* Instructions
** Implement the stack class from scratch. It contains the following methods:
- push ()
- pop ()
- top () 
- isEmpty()

** Add min() which returns the minumum element of the stack in O(1) time
** Bonus: improve min() to have an O(1) time and O(1) space optimized.

** Implement queues using the stack you made

* Usage 

```bash
make main

./main
```
