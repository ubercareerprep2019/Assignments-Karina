* Part 3: Stacks & Queues

* Usage 

*** Catch2 stands for C++ Automated Test Cases in a Header and is a multi-paradigm test framework for C++. which also supports Objective-C (and maybe C). It is primarily distributed as a single header file, although certain extensions may require additional headers.

The test target in this folder uses catch to run queue and stack tests.


#+begin_src bash
make main
make test

./main
./test
#+end_src

* Instructions
** Implement the stack class from scratch. It contains the following methods:
- push ()
- pop ()
- top () 
- isEmpty()
- min() returns the minumum element of the stack in O(1) time 
  - Bonus: improve min() to have an O(1) time and O(1) space optimized.
  - Implement queues using the stack you made

** Implement Queues using the stack method you made, containing:
- enqueue()
- dequeue()
- init()
