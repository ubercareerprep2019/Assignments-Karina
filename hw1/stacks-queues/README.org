* Part 3: Stacks

* Implement the Stack class from scratch
** Implement the functions:
- push()
  - Pushes an integer on top of the stack.

- pop()
  - Removes what is on the top of the stack, and returns that value to the caller.

- top()
  - Looks at the top value, and returns it. Does not manipulate the stack.

- isEmpty()
  - Returns a True or False if the stack is Empty or not, respectively.
